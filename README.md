#### Things to know about Plain Web Components:
1. Components are easy to create.
2. All CSS is encapsulated.
3. They are fast and easy to use in HTML pages
4. They all use the same class template (I have been modifying the class template for a while now)
5. You are not "trapped" with any Framework or Library. I saw that Xojo may incorporate Bootstrap. 

#### Things that come to my mind on how they can be used with Xojo
1. What if Xojo had a Plain Web Component Builder? That would elevate Xojo developers to the same place Javascript developers currently are.
2. Components can communicate with Xojo backend just like it is done now. I don't know how but I know this happens.
3. Opens a lot of opportunities for any Javascript developer to create web components for Xojo.
4. Before Single Page Applications (SPA) used to rule the world, now in the Javascript world we are back to the traditional Server Side rendering. Look at the hottest frameworks right now (Phoenix LiveView, Fresh, Astro, etc).
5. With some good thinking and planning Xojo can make the communication between Web Components and the back end really fast. Maybe use Web Sockets or even UDP?


So yeah, maybe Xojo Web can become the best RAD software to build web apps.
